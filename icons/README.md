# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon

You can create these icons with a maple leaf or MapleStory-themed design.

## Icon Requirements

- PNG format
- Transparent background recommended
- Simple, recognizable design
- Should work well at small sizes

## Temporary Solution

Until you add custom icons, you can:
1. Use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images as placeholders
2. Name them exactly as listed above
3. Place them in this `/icons/` directory

The extension will load without custom icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.
